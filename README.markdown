## System Requirements

Mac OS X (10.6.x, 10.7.x, 10.8.x), intel(64bit/32bit) based.

## Installation

You can either download the compiled executable file from [here](https://github.com/downloads/fotonauts/MongoHub-Mac/MongoHub.zip) 
or clone the source code and compile it on your own system.

## Build

Just build it, it should work (but let me know if you have an errors or warnings).

## Current Status

This project is very new. Any issues or bug reports are welcome. And I still don't have time to write a **usage guide**.
